### Copyâ€“until you can create <a id="copyuntilyoucancreate"></a>

Consider the following quote...

> Good artists copy; great artists steal. - Pablo Picasso

This doesn't mean rob your parents.

It means, _while you're practicing_, don't bother with original ideas. Just copy something and focus on perfecting your technique!

You can rewrite the source code line-by-line, do it totally independently, or somewhere in-between.

### How You Can Do It <a id="howyoucandoit"></a>

Find a project you'd like to copy, then pick one option...

1. Copy its source code line-by-line
2. Look at source code only when you're stuck
3. Recreate it 100% by yourself
4. Just do something!

All the choices are valid and beneficial. As you complete the project, research any syntax/patterns you find confusing.
