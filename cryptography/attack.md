# Attack

## Brute-force Attack

**An algorithm is secure when the easiest way of attacking it is by bruteforce attack.**

* Nowadays the minimum key size is 80 bits to make it impossible for a bruteforce attack. 
* To give a better security margin, the key size is recommended to be at least 128 bits.
