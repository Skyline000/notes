#### Executing a Single Line

To execute the line of source code where the cursor currently resides you press the **Ctrl+Enter** key \(or use the **Run** toolbar button\)

#### Executing Multiple Lines

There are three ways to execute multiple lines from within the editor:

* Select the lines and press the **Ctrl+Enter** key \(or use the **Run** toolbar button\); or
* After executing a selection of code, use the **Re-Run Previous Region** command \(or its associated toolbar button\) to run the same selection again. Note that changes to the selection including additional, removal, and modification of lines will be reflected in this subsequent run of the selection.
* To run the entire document press the **Ctrl+Shift+Enter** key \(or use the **Source**toolbar button\).
